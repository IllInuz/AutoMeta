# AutoMeta

AutoMeta is a Python-based tool that automatically exports GTA V vehicle meta files, simplifying the process of extracting and organizing vehicle data from `.RPF` files.

## Supported Meta Files

- [x] `handling.meta`
- [ ] `carcols.meta` (WIP)
- [ ] `carvariations.meta` (WIP)
- [ ] `vehicles.meta` (WIP)

## How It Works

1. **Export RPF Files:** Manually extract all data from within the `.RPF` files from GTA V and place them in a folder of your choice.
2. **Run AutoMeta:** Point the script to the folder where you exported the data from the `.RPF` files, you can do this at the top of the script.
3. **Automatic Export:** AutoMeta will automatically export the meta files and organize them by vehicle, so each vehicle's data can be found in its corresponding folder.
